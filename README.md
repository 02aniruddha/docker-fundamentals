# Docker Fundamentals

## Docker Images used
| Application Name                 | Docker Image Name                          |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Customized Nginx  | stacksimplify/mynginx_image1 |
| Simple SpringBoot HelloWorld | stacksimplify / dockerintro-springboot-helloworld-rest-api |


## Step-1: Docker Fundamentals
- We primarily need to understand two important flows to master Docker
    - **Flow-1:** Pull existing Docker Image from Docker Hub and Run it as a Container
    - **Flow-2:** Create a new Docker Image, Run as Container and Push to Docker Hub

## Step-2: Dockerize SpringBoot Applications
- We are going dockerize a simple SpringBoot Application.
- These steps are going to be generic for any SpringBoot Application.
- We are going to dockerize different springBoot Applications and use them in different AWS Masterclass course series. 
- This is a optional section, as we will have all pre-built containers on our AWS Masterclass series courses but it always good to learn fundamentals irrespective of whether our work profile is a Sysadmin or DevOps Admin or Developer.
